# Chord Trainer

A tiny, no-build web app to practice playing chords on your instrument. It displays random chords at a set tempo so you can drill changes, constrain by chord types and roots, and control how long each chord lasts.

## Purpose

- Help musicians practice chord recognition and fast changes.
- Provide a simple, distraction-free trainer that runs anywhere (just a browser).

## Features

- Random chord display at configurable BPM
- Beats-per-chord control (how long each chord stays)
- Filter by chord types (major, minor, 7, maj7, min7, sus2, sus4)
- Limit roots (e.g., only keys you’re working on)
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no backend, no Node.js required
